# Desktop
This is meant to be a replacement for Node.JS frontend.

# Install


# Run
## Development
````python
export FLASK_APP=desktop
export FLASK_DEBUG=true
flask run

````
if not on development, set FLASK_DEBUG=false

### Notes
1. For now we'll run off desktop
2. For production we'll need a WSGI container in front
